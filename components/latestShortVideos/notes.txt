// What i need in order to load videos


- PlaybackId
- Metadata Object = video_id && video_title && viewer_user_id

On the short videos section, I will have make an api to fetch all my videos
and loop through , displaying an MuxPlayer component for all of them

 { The api to fetch all videos may have to be a util function ? }

 I am going to have to make an api call within the server component
