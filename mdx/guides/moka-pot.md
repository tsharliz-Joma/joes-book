## Overview
Classic, rich stovetop coffee with a syrupy body and chocolate-nut notes. Great for quick morning cups or milk drinks.

## Ingredients
- **Coffee:** 18 g (medium-fine)
- **Water:** ~130–140 g to the valve (~90–94°C)
- **Yield:** ~120 ml

## Step-by-step
1. Heat water to just off boil.
2. Grind 18 g coffee medium-fine.
3. Fill base to safety valve with hot water.
4. Fill basket and level (no tamp).
5. Assemble, keeping threads dry; tighten with a towel.
6. Brew on **low heat**. As soon as flow goes **blond/sputtery**, remove.
7. Cool the base with a damp towel to stop extraction.
8. Stir in the top chamber and serve.

## Tips
- If it tastes **bitter**, shorten the brew and/or lower heat.
- If it tastes **sour**, grind slightly finer or ensure the water is hot enough.
- Light roasts: go a notch finer and push closer to 94°C water.

## Cleanup & Care
Rinse parts with warm water, dry fully, and leave disassembled to prevent odours. Avoid soap on aluminium pots.
